<h1 align="center"> 🐣<strong> My first project using HTML, JS and CSS </strong>🚩 </h1>

💻 This is my first project using web technologies and it was published on GitHub. This is a proof of concept, unfinished. 😅

The goal was to design a more accessible login page for students at the University of Pamplona 📚. This page could allow for easier login, view the latest Twiiter post, and redirect to the university's home page.

## ✅ To get started

1. Clone this repository: `https://github.com/WilmerRS/ProyectoPaginaUniversidad.git`.
2. Use your favorite browser to open the project `index.html`.
